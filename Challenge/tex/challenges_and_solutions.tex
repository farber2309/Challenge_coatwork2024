% Challenges and Solutions: Discuss any difficulties the team encountered and how they overcame them.

\begin{document}
We encountered several challenges during the competition. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The unclear formulation of the MIP model in the document which we could resolve after the discussion with the organisers.
    \item Change of the constraints one day before submution. This forced us to change the heuristics implementation, which was quite costly.
\end{itemize}

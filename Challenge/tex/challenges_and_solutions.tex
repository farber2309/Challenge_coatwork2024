% Challenges and Solutions: Discuss any difficulties the team encountered and how they overcame them.

\begin{document}
Several challenges have been encountered during the competition. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The formulation of the MIP model in the document, which we could resolve after some discussions..
    \item Change of the constraints one day before submission. This forced us to change the heuristics implementation, which also came with some effort.
\end{itemize}
We have overcome that by abandoning the MIP approach (also for other reasons).
Also our heuristics uses more flexibility incorporating new constraints.

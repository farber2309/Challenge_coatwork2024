\maketitle%
The methodology implemented in this approach is based on a greedy heuristic algorithm aimed at efficiently assigning couriers to deliveries while minimizing the total time of deliveries. The main objective is to find a solution that satisfies the problem's constraints -- such as delivery time windows, courier capacity, and route durationâ€”within a set time limit.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The greedy heuristic provides a time-efficient and flexible approach to solving the courier assignment and delivery routing problem. Its ability to adapt by incorporating backtracking and stagnation detection helps avoid infeasible results, making it well-suited for large instances where exact algorithms may be too computationally expensive.
